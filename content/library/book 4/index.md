The weather changes as we walk around a tree or turn down a street. There is a secret world of weather - one that we all live in, but very few see.

Each day we pass dozens of small weather signs that reveal what the weather is doing all around us - and what is about to happen. The clues are easy to spot when you know how, but remain invisible to most people.

In The Secret World of Weather you'll discover the simple rules that explain the weather signs. And you'll learn rare skills that enhance every minute you spend outdoors, whether you are in a town, on a beach or in a wilder spot.

As the author of the international bestsellers The Walker's Guide to Outdoor Clues and Signs and How to Read Water, Tristan Gooley knows how to de-code the phenomena and signs to look for. As he says, 'I want you to get to know these signs as I have, as characters. By studying their habits and behaviours, the signs come to life and the meaning reveals itself. From this flows an ability to read what is happening and what is about to happen'.

This is the ultimate guide to exploring an undiscovered world, one that hides in front of our eyes.

## Thoughts

5/5 - Really good

Holy toledo does this bloke know some stuff!

He seems to have an amazing knowledge of how to read the smallest clue or cue about what has happened, is happening and what will happen with the weather and not a piece of dangling seaweed anywhere in sight. Trouble is that I forget most of what he said by the tiem I get to the next paragraph. Will need to read this again..and again I expect
