On the Road swings to the rhythms of 1950s underground America, jazz, sex, generosity, chill dawns and drugs, with Sal Paradise and his hero Dean Moriarty, traveller and mystic, the living epitome of Beat. Now recognized as a modern classic, its American Dream is nearer that of Walt Whitman than Scott Fitzgerald, and it goes racing towards the sunset with unforgettable exuberance, poignancy and autobiographical passion.

## Thoughts

3/5

Might be a modern classic but really its a tale of a pretty unreliable bloke who shags about a bit and gets pissed. A literary version of Nuts! magazine. Still worth a read if you want to understand what Bob Dylas is going on about.

Glad I only spent 50p on it.
